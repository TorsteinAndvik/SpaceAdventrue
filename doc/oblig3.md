## A2 Concept

### In a nutshell

Fly around in space and fight enemy ships, aliens and meteors. Collect XP to improve abilities and gain higher levels to
upgrade your ship. Survive until the end of the game.

The player controls a spaceship travelling through space. At the start it will be a small, poor ship. By shooting down
enemy ships and meteors, you will gain XP that you can use to improve the ship's characteristics.

Parts are collected throughout the game and the ship is built by combining modules into a coherent vessel. Weapons,
shields and engines can be placed on the modules.

### Space

Large area with sporadic obstacles such as collections of rocks and lone comets that fly through space and restrict the
player's movements.

A space station can be a safe harbour where you can upgrade and repair your ship or buy new parts.

### Portals

Portals open up scattered around space. They send out hostile ships or ‚Äòaliens‚Äô. The portals will initially come from a
planet/area with enemies that are easy to fight (low level), but the level of the portal gradually increases.

The portal will, if not obstructed, send out enemies until it is finished.

### The end of the game

**Options:**

* The game becomes too difficult and you give up üôÅ
* A final boss fight
* You have managed to collect all of X, on behalf of Y
* You have collected enough Z to open a portal and go home

## A3

Our project methodology will be a juxtaposition of Kanban with TDD. In group session we will do extensive
pair programming.

Features will be created as Trello cards. Team members can assign themselves to cards and update the feature's progress
on the Kanban board.

### Meetings

We will be meeting at the seminar each week. When we get closer to the submissions deadline we will be meeting more
often.
Blom will be our creative hub.

### Communication

Our discord server will serve as the main communication tool. We track issues with the GitLab issue tracker, and
will interface in weekly standups.

### Follow up

We will work through blockers communally, and in brief coding spurts. The project
will have reasonable deliveries, corresponding to the versions in the assignment.

### Documents

Documents will be shared and stored via GitLab. Diagrams and charts will be written/charted in Mermaid and similar
and will follow the repo. The codebase will obviously be maintained at GitLab, and developers will merge their feature
branches to main
frequently. We will also have prod branch to maintain version history and landmarks as the project moves forward.

### Overall goal for the project

A 2D bullet-hell/bullet-heaven set in Space!

The player starts with a small ship. They fight enemy ships to gain resources. They can then use those resources to
upgrade their ship: Increase size to add more cannons, thrusters, shields, etc., or upgrade previously added parts.
Upgrades are added on a screen with a grid, say a 5x5 grid where the ship to begin with only fills the middle square.
Parts are added by clicking a neighbouring square on the grid, and choosing which type of part to add. Clicking an
already existing ship-piece will instead allow you to upgrade that part (if more upgrades are available). Game is won
when the player ship is fully (or at least sufficiently) upgraded.

The enemy ships have some form of AI controlled by the game: They fly around the player ship, and shoot at the player
ship. There are different types of enemy ships, with different ways of attacking (some have simple cannons, some are
kamikaze-drones, some have auto-targeting missiles, etc.). More ships spawn as time passes / possibly in waves? Possibly
from portals? Possibly from off-screen?

### User stories
#### Old user stories from oblig2
* **As a player** I need to be able to tell my ship apart from enemy ships
* **Acceptance criteria**: Player ship is visually distinct from enemy ships
* **Implementation**: Use different colors in view/textures for player ship
- Resolved: Yes.

---

* **As a player** I need to be able to tell obstacles apart from the background so that I can see how to navigate around
  them
* **Acceptance criteria**: Obstacles are visually distinct from background, or there's nothing in the background that
  looks
  like obstacles (no asteroids in the background)
* **Implementation**: Use background textures without asteroids and ships that can be mistaken for actual obstacles.
- Resolved: Yes.
---

* **As a player** I want to be able to regret an incorrect upgrade
* **Acceptance criteria**: A wrongly added / unwanted upgrade can be removed.
* **Implementation**: In code for upgrade Screen add a consent pop-up (user needs to confirm the chosen upgrade)
- Resolved: No.
---

* **As a player** with physical limitations I want to be able to remap the default keyboard controls
* **Acceptance criteria**: Players have a menu wjhere they can rebind input controls
* **Implementation**: In view add a Screen for button mapping. In controller, add method for updating the button
  mapping (e.g.
  replace effect of default key Left-arrow with the input key press from the player)
- Resolved: No.
---

* **As a developer** I need to be able to tell ships (both friendly and enemy) apart from obstacles to determine if a
  collision should occur
* **Acceptance criteria**: Developers can identify in code if a Body is the player's ship or an enemy ship, or an
  obstacle (
  e.g. asteroid)
* **Implementation**: Friendly and enemy Ships are separate classes and stored as seperate fields
- Resolved: Yes.
---

#### New User stories for oblig3

* **As a player** I want my laser shots to look distinct from enemy shots.
* **Acceptance criteria**: Shots have a different color if they originate from the player or an enemy.
* **Implementation**: All ships already have an ID, and Laser shots register their source. 
Add a new color in Palette for enemy shots. In SpaceScreen, use the source of a laser to set
the color of the LaserLig*ht.
- Resolved: No.
---

* **As a player**: I want shields to increase my health.
* **Acceptance criteria**: Adding more shield upgrades to the ship increases the max and current health.
* **Implementation**: Add a field `int health` to Shield.java, and add that amount to a ship's max and current health. Add a calculateHealth method to SpaceShip, which calculates what the total ship health should be according to the ShipStructure.
- Resolved: No.
---

* **As a player**: I want adding thruster to increase my speed and acceleration.
* **Acceptance criteria**: Adding more thruster upgrades to the ship increases the max speed and acceleration, both longitudonally and rotationally.
* **Implementation**: Add a field `float acceleration` and float `float velocity` to Thruster.java. Add acceleration and max-velocity calculations in SpaceShip that use the combined acceleration and max velocity of all thrusters in the ShipStructure, instead of the static values from PhysicsParameters. 
- Resolved: No.
---

* **As a player**: I want to battle more spaceships than the two that spawn at the start.
* **Acceptance criteria**: Additional space ships spawn as time passes. New and tougher space ships are created as time passes.
* **Implementation**: Implement a random ship generator in ShipFactory, which generates random valid space ships. This should take in parameters for how many fuselage and how many upgrades the ship should have. Add spawner logic in SpaceGameModel such that new ships spawn off screen at a given timer.

## A4

The program compiles and works as intended. We have done some pair programming.


## A5: Summary

**Communication**

Communication within the group has been successful so far. We quickly got to know each other, started working early,
clarified expectations and goals for the course, established a good dialogue, and set up a communication channel on
Discord. Ideas and thoughts shared within the group are met with respect. The feedback we provide each other is
constructive. So far, there have been no disagreements on the topic.

**Work Progress**

So far, we have completed the lab exercises, agreed on a game concept, and gained an overview of the mandatory
requirements for the course. We use Trello, a project management tool that helps teams organize and keep track of tasks:

## Retrospective
Noen av de f√∏rste m√∏tene var dedikert til √• finne et spillprosjekt som alle kunne v√¶re interessert i. Vi diskuterte ulike 2D-spillsjangre og ‚Äòsettinger‚Äô, og landet ganske s√• fort p√• et konsept med et Bullet Hell / Bullet Heaven spill satt i verdensrommet. Vi fikk s√• laget en strukturert plan for utvikling tidlig og fordelte roller over hvilke deler av spillet hver p√• gruppen ville jobbe med, og fikk notert ned ganske konkret hva vi ville lage. Det har gjort at utviklingen har g√•tt relativt fort etter de f√∏rste par m√∏tene. Gruppen er veldig samstemt i √∏nsker og m√•l for prosjektet.

Siden alle i gruppen har dagjobber, er det vanskelig √• m√∏tes oftere. Det har ikke alltid passet for alle √• m√∏te, men gruppen stiller vanligvis samlet p√• gruppetimen hver fredag (14-16). Vi savner √• kunne sitte mer sammen, tenke ut id√©er og lure m√•ter √• l√∏se problemer. Vi f√•r likevel diskutert, delt og oppklart litt saker p√• discord. Da er vi generelt samstemte n√•r vi m√∏ter p√• de fysiske fredagsm√∏tene hvor vi viser frem hva vi har jobbet med, problemer vi har m√∏tt p√•, bugs vi har oppdaget, etc. I tillegg diskuteres hva vi skal fokusere p√• den kommende uken, og eventuelt hva som skal v√¶re p√• plass til neste m√∏te. Planene deles opp i mindre features, som legges inn i Trellobrettet v√•rt, samt gamle kort som er i utvikling / ferdig flyttes i riktig statusb√∏tte. 

Vi har hatt lite konflikter underveis. Det har v√¶rt tilfeller hvor noen f√∏ler de har sagt noe dumt eller oppf√∏rt seg d√•rlig, men da har vi bedt om unnskylding og ordnet opp. Et eksempel p√• en annen uheldig situasjon var n√•r to personer jobbet med √• ordne noen bugs p√• samme feature. Der ble den ene ferdig og pushet + merget en fiks, uten √• gi beskjed videre til den andre som jobbet p√• det samme, som m√•tte fortsette √• jobbe med √• fikse et problem som allerede var fikset. Det viser igjen behovet for god kommunikasjon, og √• holde teamet oppdatert p√• hva en jobber med - s√¶rlig dem som jobber med de samme klassene og/eller features. 

Totalt sett er vi vel egentlig godt forn√∏yd med den l√∏sningen vi har landet p√•. God planlegging i starten ga oss et solid fundament som det gikk raskt √• utvikle. Bare siden oblig 2 til oblig 3 har vi gjort et gigantisk sprang i utviklingen av spillet - fra √• bare tegne og bevege noen enkle objekter p√• skjermen til √• ha full kollisjonsberegning, lyd og egenprodusert musikk, bygging og oppgradering av spillerens skip, fiendtlige skip som f√∏lger etter og skyter p√• spilleren, asteroidefabrikker som sender asteroide-regn etter spilleren, osv.
