## A2 Concept 
### In a nutshell

Fly around in space and fight enemy ships, aliens and meteors. Collect XP to improve abilities and gain higher levels to upgrade your ship. Survive until the end of the game.

The player controls a spaceship travelling through space. At the start it will be a small, poor ship. By shooting down enemy ships and meteors, you will gain XP that you can use to improve the ship's characteristics. 

Parts are collected throughout the game and the ship is built by combining modules into a coherent vessel. Weapons, shields and engines can be placed on the modules. 

### Space
Large area with sporadic obstacles such as collections of rocks and lone comets that fly through space and restrict the player's movements.

A space station can be a safe harbour where you can upgrade and repair your ship or buy new parts.


### Portals
Portals open up scattered around space. They send out hostile ships or ‚Äòaliens‚Äô. The portals will initially come from a planet/area with enemies that are easy to fight (low level), but the level of the portal gradually increases.

The portal will, if not obstructed, send out enemies until it is finished.

### The end of the game
**Options:**

* The game becomes too difficult and you give up üôÅ
* A final boss fight 
* You have managed to collect all of X, on behalf of Y
* You have collected enough Z to open a portal and go home
