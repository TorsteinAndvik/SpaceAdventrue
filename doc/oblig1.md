## A2 Concept 
### In a nutshell

Fly around in space and fight enemy ships, aliens and meteors. Collect XP to improve abilities and gain higher levels to upgrade your ship. Survive until the end of the game.

The player controls a spaceship travelling through space. At the start it will be a small, poor ship. By shooting down enemy ships and meteors, you will gain XP that you can use to improve the ship's characteristics. 

Parts are collected throughout the game and the ship is built by combining modules into a coherent vessel. Weapons, shields and engines can be placed on the modules. 

### Space
Large area with sporadic obstacles such as collections of rocks and lone comets that fly through space and restrict the player's movements.

A space station can be a safe harbour where you can upgrade and repair your ship or buy new parts.


### Portals
Portals open up scattered around space. They send out hostile ships or ‚Äòaliens‚Äô. The portals will initially come from a planet/area with enemies that are easy to fight (low level), but the level of the portal gradually increases.

The portal will, if not obstructed, send out enemies until it is finished.

### The end of the game
**Options:**

* The game becomes too difficult and you give up üôÅ
* A final boss fight 
* You have managed to collect all of X, on behalf of Y
* You have collected enough Z to open a portal and go home

## A3 
Our project methodology will be a juxtaposition of Kanban with TDD. In group session we will do extensive
pair programming. 

### Meetings 
We will be meeting at the seminar each week. When we get closer to the submissions deadline we will be meeting more often. 
Blom will be our creative hub.

### Communication 
Our discord server will serve as the main communication tool. We track issues with the GitLab issue tracker, and
will interface in weekly standups.

### Division of labor 
* *Tor* - Game design, tester
* *Flemming* - Render engineer, texture artist, 
* *Torstein* - Game developer, tester
* *Henrik* - CI, integration, modelling, builds, project manager(?)
* *Yasmina* - UI/UX designer, sound engineer, community manager


### Follow up 
We will work through blockers communally, and in brief coding spurts. The project 
will have reasonable deliveries, corresponding to the versions in the assignment. 

### Documents 
Documents will be shared and stored via GitLab. Diagrams and charts will be written/charted in Mermaid and similar
and will follow the repo. The codebase will obviously be maintained at GitLab, and developers will merge their feature branches to main
frequently. We will also have prod branch to maintain version history and landmarks as the project moves forward.
