## A3 
Our project methodology will be a juxtaposition of Kanban with TDD. In group session we will do extensive
pair programming. 

### Meetings 
We will be meeting at the seminar each week. When we get closer to the submissions deadline we will be meeting more often. 
Blom will be our creative hub.

### Communication 
Our discord server will serve as the main communication tool. We track issues with the GitLab issue tracker, and
will interface in weekly standups.

### Division of labor 
*Tor* - Game design, tester
*Flemming* - Render engineer, texture artist, 
*Torstein* - Game developer, tester
*Henrik* - CI, integration, modelling, builds, project manager(?)
*Yasmina* - UI/UX designer, sound engineer, community manager


### Follow up 
We will work through blockers communally, and in brief coding spurts. The project 
will have reasonable deliveries, corresponding to the versions in the assignment. 

### Documents 
Documents will be shared and stored via GitLab. Diagrams and charts will be written/charted in Mermaid and similar
and will follow the repo. The codebase will obviously be maintained at GitLab, and developers will merge their feature branches to main
frequently. We will also have prod branch to maintain version history and landmarks as the project moves forward.
